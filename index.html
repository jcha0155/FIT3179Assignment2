                <p>This visualisation aims to shed light into the severity of
                homicide in the South Amercian region so that readers can be more aware about the dangers faced by
                the South American people, and to be informed about the severity of danger in visiting these countries.

                    <p>In the following visualisation, we firstly see the Death Rate Per 100,000 for the whole world. What is obvious
                        in this map is that the South American, Central American, and some South African countries appear to have a darker colour, <span class = 'homicide_text'> indicating a higher homicide death rate. </span> 
                        From this, we can conclude that these regions are more violent than many other regions in the world (Roser & Ritchie, 2013).

                    <p> 
                        Regions such as Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania score <b><span class = 'homicide_text'> very low in the death rate
                        per 100,000 due to homicide (less than 5). </span> </b>These are then considered to be safer regions in the world.

                    <p> From here we see a closer look up into the homicide rate of the region as of 2019. We notice that countries such as Brazil
                        , Colombia, Venezuela take the lead in having <b><span class = 'homicide_text'> at least 30 homicide deaths per 100,000 residents </span></b> in their respective
                        countries. This is an alarming rate which deserves further attention.
                        </p>
                </div>

                <div id = 'slant_left'>
                <p> The exact number of homicide deaths has been displayed in contrast with the exact population of 
                    each country. As we can see, although Brazil's <b> <span class = 'homicide_text'> number of homicide cases far exceeds </span> </b>the number of homicide
                    cases of the other countries, it is only so because Brazil has a far greater population compared to the other countries.

        <div id = 'slant_left_and_right'>
            <p> It's worth noting that there are various causes to the high homicide rates in South America. Most notably, 
                we could see that a <b><span class = 'unemployment_and_income_text'> high unemployment rate </span></b> is one of the leading factors. Take for example, the homicide rate of 
                Colombia. Let's contrast it with the unemployment rate of Colombia. We will then notice that from 1999 to 2003,
                an increase in unemployment accompanied an increase in homicide.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id = 'slant_left_and_right'>
            <div id="chart4n5"></div>
        </div>
        
        <div id = 'slant_left_and_right'>
        <p> Something else worth paying attention to is to investigate the role income inequality has caused the increase
            in homicides (Roser & Ortiz-Ospina, 2013).

            A notable trend is that Peru went through <b><span class = 'unemployment_and_income_text'> a gradual drop in income inequality from 1994 to 2019 </span></b>,
            which accompanied the drop in homicide and unemployment from the same years as well. 

            This shows us that <b><span class = 'unemployment_and_income_text'> income inequality does play an effect in curbing the high homicide rates in the region. </span></b>
